Extracted content:
Looking at the provided page content, I can see this is actually a "Contact Us" page for the Amazon Product Advertising API, not the "API Rates" page you were looking for. However, I can see there's a link to the API Rates page in the navigation. Let me extract the content from this Contact Us page and note the relevant API Rates link.
